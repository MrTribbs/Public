//To set up incremental refresh in Power BI, follow these steps: 

Define Parameters:
  - Create two parameters: RangeStart and RangeEnd.
  - Set their data type to Date/Time.
  - Provide default values (e.g., 1/1/2023 for RangeStart and = DateTime.LocalNow() for RangeEnd).

Modify the Query:
  - Modify your existing MySQL query to filter data based on these parameters.
  - Use the RangeStart and RangeEnd parameters in your WHERE clause.
  - Example:
      SELECT *
      FROM YourTable
      WHERE DateColumn >= @RangeStart AND DateColumn < @RangeEnd
 
Enable Incremental Refresh:
  - In Power BI Desktop, select the table you want to enable incremental refresh for.
  - Go to the Modeling tab, then Manage Parameters.
  - Define the parameters RangeStart and RangeEnd with the appropriate data types.
  - Go to the table's properties and click on Incremental Refresh.
  - Enable Incremental Refresh and configure it with the parameters. You can set how many days/months/years of data to store and how often to refresh.

Publish to Power BI Service:
  - Once the incremental refresh is set up in Power BI Desktop, publish the dataset to the Power BI Service.
  - Configure the dataset in the Power BI Service to refresh based on your schedule.
